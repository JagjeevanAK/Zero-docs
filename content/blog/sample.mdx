Email has been the backbone of digital communication for decades, yet most email clients haven't evolved much since the early 2000s. Enter **Zero** - an open-source, AI-powered email solution that's reimagining how we interact with our inbox.

## What Makes Zero Different?

In a world dominated by closed-source email providers that harvest your data, Zero stands out with its commitment to:
